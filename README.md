# Project: Accommodation Advisory Tool

## Introduction
An accommodation advisory tool is essential for users seeking suitable lodging. This case study delves into the development of an accommodation advisory system, utilizing machine learning, particularly focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer reviews and ratings. The objective is to predict and recommend accommodation based on user preferences and past reviews.

## Objective
The primary goal is to create a personalized accommodation advisory tool that incorporates user reviews and ratings. By employing machine learning techniques, the aim is to offer users tailored suggestions, thereby enhancing their overall experience in selecting the best accommodation for their specific requirements.

## Tools and Technologies
To implement the accommodation advisory tool, the following tools and technologies will be used:
- Python programming language
- Libraries:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations and computations.
  - Data visualisation.
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For Natural Language Processing tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about accommodation providers, including customer reviews and ratings.
